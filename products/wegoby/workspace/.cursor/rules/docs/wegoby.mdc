> **Apply Intelligently** - What is Wegoby, vision, and mission.

## What is Wegoby?

Wegoby is an AI-powered personalization platform that creates adaptive digital experiences evolving together with the user.

**Tagline**: "Your AI-powered journey to customized experiences"

## Core Philosophy: User is the Dev

> **The user IS the developer.** Instead of building apps and guessing what users want, we build small services that users can modify via AI to make it their own.

**Traditional approach**: Developer → App → User (developer guesses user needs)

**Wegoby approach**: User ↔ AI ↔ App (user shapes their own experience)

**"The user of the user is the user."** — Every Wegoby user is simultaneously:
- A user of the platform
- A developer of their own experience
- The beneficiary of their own customizations

## Products

### to-* Miniapps

Each Wegoby product is accessed via a `to-*` path:

| Product | Path | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| to-read | `/to-read` | Personalized reading experience |
| to-eat | `/to-eat` | Meal planning and recipes |
| to-note | `/to-note` | Note-taking and journaling |

These are not separate products, but **different expressions of the same experiential core**.

Each to-* miniapp:
- Uses Sensetree for persona understanding
- Uses Percepta for adaptive rendering
- Explores personalization within a specific life domain

### Sensetree

The "feeling" side — Wegoby's empathic AI trained on deep user personas to approximate inner experience.

See: [domains/sensetree/](../../../domains/sensetree/)

### Percepta

The "doing" side — Wegoby's adaptive UI engine that brings Sensetree's insights to life through runtime + AI operator + adaptive UI.

See: [domains/percepta/](../../../domains/percepta/)
