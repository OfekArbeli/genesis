# Sensetree

> **Apply Intelligently** - Wegoby's empathic AI and EI principles.

## What is Sensetree?

Sensetree is Wegoby's empathic AI—trained on deep user personas to approximate inner experience.

It's the "feeling" side of Wegoby, while Percepta is the "doing" side.

## Core Principles

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **What** | AI model/service that "experiences" like a user |
| **Foundation** | Emotional Intelligence (EI) research |
| **Approach** | "Becoming the user, not observing the user" |
| **Models** | Emotional dynamics, not static traits |
| **Output** | Experiential preferences that guide system behavior |

## Emotional Intelligence (EI)

The research foundation inside Sensetree.

EI focuses on how emotions emerge from:
- **Perception** — How we sense the world
- **Memory** — How past experiences shape present
- **Context** — Situational factors
- **Meaning** — Personal significance

EI is not psychology as classification, but experience as a living, evolving process.

## Persona Levels

Sensetree models users across multiple levels:

### Level 1: Sensorimotor & Virtual Homeostasis

| Dimension | What It Captures |
|-----------|------------------|
| Resource levels | Energy, attention capacity |
| System integrity | Stress, cognitive load |
| Innate affordances | Natural preferences |

### Level 2: Affective Construction & Cultural Priors

| Dimension | What It Captures |
|-----------|------------------|
| Cultural norms | Background expectations |
| Arousal interpretation | How excitement/calm is processed |
| Somatic markers | Gut feelings, intuitions |

### Level 3: Conceptual World-Model & Social Affordances

| Dimension | What It Captures |
|-----------|------------------|
| High-level affordances | Perceived possibilities |
| Active inference commitments | Beliefs driving behavior |
| Social context | Relationship to others |

### Level 4: Attentional Schema & Metacognitive Strategy

| Dimension | What It Captures |
|-----------|------------------|
| Attention model | What gets focus |
| Strategic override | Conscious control |
| Importance gating | Priority filtering |

### Wrapper: Identity & Plasticity

| Dimension | What It Captures |
|-----------|------------------|
| Learning rates | How fast adaptation occurs |
| Narrative processing | Story-making tendencies |
| Integration | How parts form whole |

## Integration Points

### With Percepta

Sensetree provides persona data that Percepta uses for:
- Theme selection
- Layout preferences
- Content pacing
- Interaction style

### With Miniapps

Each miniapp can:
- Request persona questions
- Receive persona-based recommendations
- Adapt to user preferences

## API Contract

Sensetree exposes:

```typescript
// Get user persona
GET /api/sensetree/persona/{userId}

// Update persona from interaction
POST /api/sensetree/interaction
{
  userId: string,
  event: InteractionEvent,
  context: Context
}

// Get recommendations
GET /api/sensetree/recommendations/{userId}?domain={domain}
```
