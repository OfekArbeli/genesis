# Emotional Intelligence (EI) Research

The research foundation inside Sensetree.

## Core Principle

EI focuses on how emotions emerge from:
- **Perception** — How we sense the world
- **Memory** — How past experiences shape present
- **Context** — Situational factors
- **Meaning** — Personal significance

EI is not psychology as classification, but **experience as a living, evolving process**.

## Key Insight

> "Becoming the user, not observing the user"

Traditional personalization observes behavior patterns. Sensetree aims to model the underlying experience that generates those behaviors.

## Emotional Dynamics

We model emotions as dynamic processes, not static traits:

### Process Model

```
Stimulus → Perception → Interpretation → Response → Feedback
    ↑                                                  ↓
    └────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Key Properties

1. **Context-Dependent**: Same stimulus, different contexts = different responses
2. **History-Sensitive**: Past experiences color present interpretations
3. **Self-Modifying**: Emotions change the system that produces them
4. **Predictive**: Emotions anticipate, not just react

## Research Areas

### 1. Affective Computing

Understanding how to computationally model affect:
- Valence (positive/negative)
- Arousal (high/low energy)
- Dominance (control level)

### 2. Embodied Cognition

How physical state influences mental state:
- Fatigue affects decision-making
- Stress changes attention patterns
- Comfort influences openness

### 3. Cultural Priors

How cultural background shapes experience:
- Communication styles
- Value hierarchies
- Social norms

### 4. Narrative Self

How we construct identity through stories:
- Self-concept
- Aspirations
- Meaning-making

## Application to Wegoby

### Persona Modeling

Sensetree models users across 5 levels:

1. **Sensorimotor**: Basic system state
2. **Affective**: Emotional and cultural context
3. **Conceptual**: Beliefs and goals
4. **Attentional**: Focus and priorities
5. **Identity**: Self-concept and plasticity

### Adaptive UI

EI insights drive UI adaptations:
- Pacing based on cognitive load
- Tone based on emotional state
- Layout based on attention patterns
- Content based on meaning preferences
