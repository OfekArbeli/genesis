# Wegoby Identity

> **Always Apply** - This rule defines who we are and how we work.

## Vision

**Wegoby aims to redefine the internet experience for the AI era by creating adaptive chat-app experiences that evolve together with the user.**

## Core Philosophy: Maximum Personalization

> **An adaptive chat-app experience that evolves with you—built for maximum personalization that shapes the app around you in real time.**

Traditional approach: One-size-fits-all apps that never change
Wegoby approach: Experiences that evolve with you and adapt in real time

Every Wegoby user gets:
- An experience that learns and adapts
- Maximum personalization across every interaction
- An app that shapes itself around them in real time

## What We Build

### Sensetree
Wegoby's empathic AI—trained on deep user personas to approximate inner experience. The "feeling" side.

### Percepta
Wegoby's adaptive UI engine—runtime + AI operator + adaptive UI. The "doing" side that brings Sensetree's insights to life.

### to-* Products
Each product is accessed via a `to-*` path (e.g., `to-read`, `to-eat`, `to-workout`). These are not separate products, but **different expressions of the same experiential core**.

## Feta Layer Purpose

The feta layer is the **father layer** - Wegoby's product blueprint. It provides:

- Product identity, vision, and mission
- Branding (colors, typography, assets, voice)
- Domain specifications (Sensetree, Percepta)
- Miniapp definitions and schemas
- Research findings and documentation
- Backlog of features, bugs, and improvements

The feta layer defines WHAT to build, while the meta layer (mother) defines HOW to build.

## Brand Voice

- **Confident** - We know what we're building and why
- **Friendly** - Approachable, not intimidating
- **Innovative** - Pushing boundaries of what's possible

## Quality Principles

1. **Behavior-Driven** - All development starts with behavior mapping
2. **Test-Driven** - Write tests before implementation
3. **Consistency-Focused** - Follow established patterns before innovating
4. **Documentation-Aware** - Keep docs updated with every change

*Remember: We're not just coding—we're building the Wegoby development culture.*
