> **Apply Intelligently** - Core vocabulary and concepts.

## Core Concepts

### Sensetree

Wegoby's empathic AI—trained on deep user personas to approximate inner experience.

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **What** | AI model/service that "experiences" like a user |
| **Foundation** | Emotional Intelligence (EI) research |
| **Approach** | "Becoming the user, not observing the user" |
| **Output** | Experiential preferences guiding system behavior |

### Percepta

Wegoby's adaptive UI engine—the "doing" side.

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **What** | Runtime engine + AI operator + adaptive UI |
| **Purpose** | Renders and adapts UI based on Sensetree data |
| **Components** | Renderer, state store, event bus, widgets, templates |
| **AI Role** | Master operator via Command API |

### Emotional Intelligence (EI)

The research foundation inside Sensetree. Focuses on how emotions emerge from perception, memory, context, and meaning.

Not psychology as classification, but experience as a living process.

### Meta Layer

The coordination layer that manages complexity without performing work.

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Cognitive Scaffold** | Mental framework for developers |
| **Context Guide** | Shared understanding for AI agents |
| **Guardian** | Maintains conceptual integrity |

### Miniapp

A `to-*` product (e.g., to-read, to-eat). Not separate codebases—domain configurations that run on Percepta.

### Persona

Mathematical representation of a user across multiple levels:
1. Sensorimotor & Virtual Homeostasis
2. Affective Construction & Cultural Priors
3. Conceptual World-Model & Social Affordances
4. Attentional Schema & Metacognitive Strategy
5. Identity & Plasticity (Wrapper)

## Adaptive System Terms

### Baseline

Company defaults for Context—what Wegoby thinks is the best UX for most users.

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Role** | Seeds each user's Context with sensible defaults |
| **Evolution** | Updates over time via Baseline Evolution |
| **Schema** | `feta/domains/schemas/baseline-schema.json` |

### Context

User's personalized UX state across 5 dimensions:

| Dimension | Focus |
|-----------|-------|
| **Presentation** | Surface—how info is displayed (layout, theme, typography) |
| **Cognition** | Density—how content is conveyed (detail, tone, load) |
| **Autonomy** | Agency—who leads (user vs system, confirmations) |
| **Continuity** | Temporal—time/history (memory, sessions, anticipation) |
| **Intent** | Content matching—what's relevant (goals, interests) |

Schema: `feta/domains/schemas/context-schema.json`

### Structure

View configuration—what UI components exist and how they're arranged.

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Source** | Miniapp definition (views/*.json) |
| **Modifiable** | Yes, via Evolve Mode |
| **Scope** | App-specific, not personalized |

### Use Mode

Chat mode where AI operates the app **for** the user.

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Actions** | Create entities, query data, navigate views |
| **Output** | Interactions |
| **Feedback** | Can update Context (learns preferences) |

### Evolve Mode

Chat mode where AI modifies the app's **configuration**.

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Actions** | Change views, add widgets, create rules |
| **Output** | Modifications |
| **Feedback** | Updates Structure directly |

### Baseline Evolution

Process where aggregated user patterns update Baseline defaults.

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Trigger** | >50% of users deviate from a Baseline value |
| **Effect** | Baseline updates to reflect better default |
| **Purpose** | Collective intelligence improves defaults for everyone |

## Workflow Terms

### Task

A unit of work with ID format: `{uuid}-{short-name}`

Example: `a1b2c3d4-add-book-generation`

### Phases

```
creating → researching → planning → implementing → shipping → learning → done
```

### Workflow Profiles

| Profile | Flow | Use For |
|---------|------|---------|
| Full | research → plan → implement → ship → learn | New features |
| Focused | plan → implement → ship | Medium tasks |
| Quick | implement → ship | Bug fixes |

## Command Terms

### Action

Single, pure operation. Level 1 command.

Examples: `/create-task`, `/validate`, `/commit`

### Flow

Orchestrates multiple actions. Level 2 command.

Examples: `/prepare`, `/ship`, `/learn`

### Pipeline

End-to-end workflow. Level 3 command.

Examples: `/do`

## Technical Terms

### Domain Layer

Pure business logic, no UI or external dependencies.

### Service Layer

Orchestrates domain logic and external services.

### Command API

Restricted interface for AI to interact with Percepta.

Categories: entity, view, rule, ui

### Design Tokens

Named values for colors, typography, spacing. Defined in branding/, consumed by projects.
