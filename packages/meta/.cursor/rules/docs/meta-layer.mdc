# Meta Layer

> **Apply Intelligently** - What is the meta layer and how it works.

## What is the Meta Layer?

The meta layer is the **mother layer** - a product-agnostic orchestration system that provides the environment for how agents and humans should work together. It's the DNA of any SaaS R&D team.

Think of it as an **AI-native development operating system**.

## Purpose

> **Enable product engineers to create amazing production-ready products using AI.**

The meta layer provides:

- Product-agnostic rules, workflows, and conventions
- Full R&D playbook (not just development - branding, UX, research, etc.)
- Self-improving rules that learn from every feature and bug
- Cognitive scaffold for product engineers
- Context guide for AI agents
- The "womb" (`repos/`) where implementations grow

## The Family Model

```
Meta (Mother) + Feta (Father) = Development Environment
                                      ↓
                            Product Engineer acts here
                                      ↓
                              Implementation (Child)
                              Lives in meta/repos/
```

- **Meta** (Mother): HOW to do things - product-agnostic orchestration
- **Feta** (Father): WHAT to build - product-specific blueprints
- **Implementation** (Child): The actual code, born from Meta + Feta

## Key Principle

**If you could copy this to a completely different SaaS project and it would still make sense, it belongs in Meta.**

The Meta layer teaches HOW to do any product engineering activity, not WHAT to build.

## Rules vs Commands

| Aspect | Rules | Commands |
|--------|-------|----------|
| **Purpose** | HOW to do things | WHAT + WHERE |
| **Activation** | Always/Intelligently | Manual trigger |
| **Think of as** | Guardrails | Shortcuts |

## Rule Categories

| Category | Location | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Core | `rules/core/` | Always applied |
| Instructions | `rules/instructions/` | How to do activities |
| Docs | `rules/docs/` | Context providers |

## Command Levels

| Level | Folder | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Actions | `commands/actions/` | Single operations |
| Flows | `commands/flows/` | Orchestrate actions |
| Pipelines | `commands/pipelines/` | End-to-end |

## The Product Engineer

The product engineer is the new developer - a full-stack creator who uses the Meta layer's R&D playbook to bring Feta's blueprints to life.

```
Product Engineer = Developer + Designer + Product Manager + Researcher
                   (enabled by AI, guided by Meta, building from Feta)
```

They are the magician of experiences, creating anything by any means necessary in the **correct, validated, agreed-upon way**.

## Self-Improvement

The meta layer learns through:

1. `/reflect` — Compare plan vs outcome
2. `/contribute` — Extract learnings
3. Learnings appended to relevant instruction rules

Each instruction file has a `## Learnings` section that grows over time.
