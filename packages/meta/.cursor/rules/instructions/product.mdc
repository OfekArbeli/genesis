# Product Instructions

> **Apply Intelligently** - How to define products, write specs, and prioritize work.

## Scope

**In scope**: Product definition, feature specs, prioritization, roadmapping
**Not in scope**: Implementation details (→ dev.mdc), User research (→ research.mdc)

## Product Definition

### Vision Statement

A good vision statement answers:
- **Who** is this for?
- **What** problem does it solve?
- **Why** does it matter?
- **How** is it different?

Template:
```
For [target user] who [has this problem],
[Product name] is a [category]
that [key benefit].
Unlike [competitors],
our product [unique differentiator].
```

### Mission Statement

Mission = What you do every day to achieve the vision.

- Vision: Where you're going
- Mission: How you get there

## Feature Specification

### Feature Document Structure

```markdown
# Feature: {feature-name}

## Problem Statement
What user problem does this solve?

## User Stories
As a [user type], I want to [action] so that [benefit].

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Measurable outcome 1
- [ ] Measurable outcome 2

## Scope
### In Scope
- Specific capability 1
- Specific capability 2

### Out of Scope
- Not doing X (explain why)

## Design
[Link to designs or describe UX]

## Technical Considerations
[Non-obvious technical implications]

## Metrics
How will we measure success?

## Risks
What could go wrong?
```

### User Stories

Format: `As a [user], I want to [action] so that [benefit]`

✅ Good:
```
As a reader, I want to track my daily reading streak 
so that I stay motivated to read consistently.
```

❌ Bad:
```
As a user, I want a streak counter.
(No benefit, vague user)
```

### Acceptance Criteria

Use Given-When-Then format:

```
Given [context]
When [action]
Then [expected result]
```

Example:
```
Given I have read for 3 consecutive days
When I open the app
Then I see "3-day streak" on my dashboard
```

## Prioritization

### Priority Frameworks

#### MoSCoW Method

| Priority | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Must Have** | Critical for launch, non-negotiable |
| **Should Have** | Important, but not critical |
| **Could Have** | Nice to have if time permits |
| **Won't Have** | Explicitly out of scope |

#### Impact vs Effort Matrix

```
High Impact │ Quick Wins    │ Major Projects
            │ (Do First)    │ (Plan Carefully)
            ├───────────────┼─────────────────
Low Impact  │ Fill-ins      │ Time Sinks
            │ (Do If Time)  │ (Avoid)
            └───────────────┴─────────────────
              Low Effort      High Effort
```

#### RICE Scoring

```
Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort

Reach: How many users affected (number)
Impact: How much value (0.25 to 3)
Confidence: How sure are you (0-100%)
Effort: Person-months of work
```

### Priority Guidelines

| Priority | Description | Timeline |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **High** | Blocking other work, critical | This week |
| **Medium** | Important, not blocking | This sprint |
| **Low** | Nice to have | Backlog |

## Roadmap Planning

### Time Horizons

| Horizon | Detail Level | Purpose |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| Now (2 weeks) | Task-level detail | Execution |
| Next (1-2 months) | Feature-level | Planning |
| Later (3-6 months) | Theme-level | Direction |

### Release Planning

```markdown
## Release: {version}

### Theme
[What's the focus of this release?]

### Features
1. [Feature 1] - [status]
2. [Feature 2] - [status]

### Success Metrics
- [Metric 1]
- [Metric 2]

### Dependencies
- [External dependency]
```

## Product Thinking

### Jobs to Be Done (JTBD)

Focus on what users are trying to accomplish:

```
When [situation],
I want to [motivation],
so I can [expected outcome].
```

Example:
```
When I finish reading for the day,
I want to log my progress quickly,
so I can maintain my streak without friction.
```

### Kano Model

| Feature Type | User Expectation | Satisfaction |
|--------------|------------------|--------------|
| **Basic** | Expected, not requested | Absent = Frustrated |
| **Performance** | More is better | Linear satisfaction |
| **Delight** | Unexpected, impressive | Creates loyalty |

## Anti-Patterns

### Avoid

- **Feature soup**: Adding features without cohesive vision
- **Spec by committee**: Over-specifying everything
- **Gold plating**: Perfecting before validating
- **Scope creep**: Growing scope during implementation
- **Solution-first**: Starting with solution before understanding problem

### Warning Signs

- "We should also add..."
- "While we're at it..."
- "Users might want..."
- Specs longer than the implementation

## Stakeholder Communication

### Status Updates

```markdown
## {Project} Status - {Date}

### Progress
- ✅ Completed: [what shipped]
- 🔄 In Progress: [what's being worked on]
- ⏳ Blocked: [what's waiting]

### Metrics
- [Key metric]: [value]

### Next Week
- [Priority 1]
- [Priority 2]

### Risks
- [Risk and mitigation]
```
