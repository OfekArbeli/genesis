## Creating Personas

### Step 1: Gather Data

Sources for persona data:
- User interviews
- Analytics data
- Support tickets
- Survey responses
- Market research
- Team assumptions (validated later)

### Step 2: Identify Patterns

Group users by:
- **Goals**: What they're trying to achieve
- **Behaviors**: How they act
- **Context**: When/where they use product
- **Attitudes**: How they feel about the domain

### Step 3: Create Persona

1. Choose a representative user pattern
2. Give them a name and photo
3. Fill in the template
4. Add a memorable quote
5. Validate with team and data

### Step 4: Socialize

- Present to the team
- Post in visible locations
- Reference in discussions
- Use in design reviews

### Empathy Map Questions

| Quadrant | Questions |
|----------|-----------|
| **Says** | What do they literally say? Quotes from interviews? |
| **Thinks** | What occupies their thoughts? Worries? Aspirations? |
| **Does** | What actions do they take? Observable behaviors? |
| **Feels** | What emotions do they experience? What matters to them? |

## Persona Types

### Primary Persona

The main target user. Design for them first.
- Represents the largest or most important user segment
- All features should serve this persona
- Conflicts resolved in their favor

### Secondary Persona

Important but not primary. Accommodate when possible.
- Features shouldn't harm their experience
- Nice-to-have features may serve them
- Don't design primarily for them

### Negative Persona

Who you're NOT building for. Explicitly exclude.
- Helps say "no" to feature requests
- Clarifies focus
- Example: "Power users who want Excel-like complexity"

## Persona Evolution

Personas aren't static. Update them as you learn.

### When to Update

- New user research findings
- Significant product pivot
- Market changes
- Analytics reveal new patterns

### Evolution Process

1. Review existing persona
2. Compare against new data
3. Highlight changes
4. Update document
5. Communicate to team

## Using Personas

### In Design Decisions

```
"Would Sarah understand this?"
"Does this help Marcus achieve his goal?"
"Is this frustration we're creating for Alex?"
```

### In Prioritization

```
"This feature serves our primary persona directly"
"This is for a secondary persona - nice to have"
"This serves our negative persona - don't build"
```

### In Communication

```
"For readers like Sarah who struggle with consistency..."
"Marcus told us in interviews that..."
"This addresses Alex's main frustration..."
```

## Anti-Patterns

### Avoid

- **Generic personas**: "Young professional" without specifics
- **Demographic-only**: Age/income without goals/frustrations
- **Wishful thinking**: Describing ideal user, not real user
- **Too many personas**: More than 3-4 dilutes focus
- **Static personas**: Never updated with new learnings
- **Shelf personas**: Created but never used

### Warning Signs

- Team doesn't know persona names
- Personas not referenced in discussions
- Features don't map to persona needs
- Everyone interprets personas differently

## Persona Quality Checklist

### Weak Persona

- ❌ Based on assumptions only
