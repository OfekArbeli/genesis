# Branding Instructions

> **Apply Intelligently** - How to create and maintain brand systems and identity.

## Scope

**In scope**: Brand identity, visual systems, voice & tone, brand guidelines
**Not in scope**: UI component design (→ design.mdc), Copy writing (→ content.mdc)

## What is a Brand?

A brand is not just a logo—it's the complete experience and perception users have of your product. It includes visual identity, voice, values, and the emotional connection users form.

### Brand Components

| Component | What It Includes |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Identity** | Name, logo, tagline, mission, values |
| **Visual** | Colors, typography, imagery, layout patterns |
| **Voice** | Tone, personality, communication style |
| **Experience** | How the brand feels at every touchpoint |

## Brand Identity

### Name

A good product name is:
- **Memorable**: Easy to recall
- **Pronounceable**: Can be said out loud
- **Spellable**: Users can type it correctly
- **Unique**: Searchable, no conflicts
- **Meaningful**: Connects to purpose (optional but helpful)

### Tagline

A tagline captures the essence in one line.

Structure: `[Benefit/Promise] + [Differentiator]`

Examples:
- "Your AI-powered journey to customized experiences"
- "Experience the web your way"

### Mission Statement

Template:
```
We [action] for [audience] by [method],
so they can [benefit].
```

### Values

3-5 core values that guide decisions:

| Value | Meaning | How It Shows |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| Value 1 | What it means | How it manifests |
| Value 2 | What it means | How it manifests |

## Visual Identity

### Logo

Logo types:
- **Wordmark**: Name in stylized text
- **Symbol**: Icon/graphic only
- **Combination**: Symbol + wordmark

Logo requirements:
- Works at small sizes (favicon)
- Works at large sizes (billboard)
- Works in single color (black/white)
- Has clear space rules
- Has minimum size rules

### Color Palette

#### Primary Colors

Main brand colors used for key elements.

```json
{
  "primary": {
    "DEFAULT": "#8B5CF6",
    "50": "#FAF5FF",
    "100": "#F3E8FF",
    "500": "#8B5CF6",
    "600": "#7C3AED",
    "900": "#4C1D95"
  }
}
```

#### Secondary Colors

#### Semantic Colors

Colors with specific meanings:

| Color | Purpose |
|-------|---------|

#### Color Guidelines

- Maintain contrast ratios (WCAG AA: 4.5:1)

- Be consistent across touchpoints
- Document when/where to use each color

### Typography

#### Font Selection

Choose fonts that:
- Are readable at all sizes
- Support needed languages
- Have enough weights
- Match brand personality
- Load performantly

#### Type Scale

```json
{
  "scale": {
    "xs": "0.75rem",
    "sm": "0.875rem",
    "base": "1rem",
    "lg": "1.125rem",
    "xl": "1.25rem",
    "2xl": "1.5rem",
    "3xl": "1.875rem",
    "4xl": "2.25rem"
  }
}
```

#### Font Pairing

- **Heading font**: For titles, display text
- **Body font**: For readable content
- **Mono font**: For code, technical content

### Imagery

#### Photography Style

Define:
- Subject matter (people, nature, abstract)
- Mood (warm, cool, bright, moody)
- Composition preferences
- Filters/treatments

#### Illustration Style

Define:
- Style (flat, 3D, hand-drawn)
- Line weight
- Color usage
- Level of detail

#### Iconography

Define:
- Style (outlined, filled, duo-tone)
- Stroke weight
- Corner radius
- Consistent metaphors

## Brand Voice

### Personality Traits

Define 3-5 personality traits:

| Trait | Meaning | Do | Don't |
|-------|---------|-----|-------|
| Friendly | Approachable, warm | "Let's get started!" | "Proceed to initiate" |
| Confident | Assured, capable | "We've got you covered" | "We might be able to help" |

### Tone Variations

Same voice, different tones for different contexts:

| Context | Tone | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| Success | Celebratory | "You did it! 🎉" |
| Error | Helpful | "Something went wrong. Let's fix it." |
| Onboarding | Encouraging | "You're almost there!" |
| Empty state | Inviting | "Ready to add your first book?" |

### Writing Principles

1. **Be clear**: Clarity over cleverness
2. **Be concise**: Fewer words, more impact
3. **Be human**: Natural, conversational
4. **Be consistent**: Same patterns throughout
5. **Be helpful**: Always guide next action
