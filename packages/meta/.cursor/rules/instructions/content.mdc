# Content Instructions

> **Apply Intelligently** - Tone, terminology, and writing style.

## Scope

**In scope**: Tone, terminology, writing style
**Not in scope**: UI component text (→ design.mdc)

## Brand Voice

Wegoby's voice is:

| Trait | Meaning | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **Confident** | We know what we're building | "Your personalized experience awaits" |
| **Friendly** | Approachable, not corporate | "Let's get started!" |
| **Innovative** | Forward-thinking | "Experience AI-powered personalization" |

## Writing Guidelines

### Be Concise

```
✅ "Add to reading list"
❌ "Click here to add this book to your personal reading list"
```

### Be Clear

```
✅ "Your password must be at least 8 characters"
❌ "Password validation failed: minimum length requirement not met"
```

### Be Helpful

```
✅ "No books found. Try searching for a different title."
❌ "No results."
```

## UI Text Patterns

### Buttons

| Action Type | Pattern | Example |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| Primary action | Verb | "Save", "Create", "Submit" |
| Navigation | Destination | "Go to Dashboard" |
| Destructive | Confirm action | "Delete Book" |

### Error Messages

Structure: What happened + What to do

```
✅ "We couldn't save your changes. Please try again."
❌ "Error 500: Internal Server Error"
```

### Empty States

Structure: What's missing + How to fix

```
✅ "No books in your library yet. Add your first book to get started."
❌ "No data available"
```

### Success Messages

Structure: What happened + What's next (optional)

```
✅ "Book added to your reading list!"
✅ "Settings saved. Changes will take effect immediately."
```

## Terminology

### Consistent Terms

| Use | Don't Use |
|-----|-----------|
| Sign in | Log in, Login |
| Sign up | Register, Create account |
| Reading list | Book list, Library |
| Dashboard | Home page |

### Wegoby-Specific Terms

| Term | Definition | Usage |
|------|------------|-------|
| Miniapp | A to-* product | "Each miniapp adapts to you" |
| Persona | User profile/preferences | "Based on your persona" |
| Adaptive | Changes based on user | "Adaptive experience" |

## Formatting

### Numbers

- Use numerals for most cases: "3 books"
- Spell out at sentence start: "Three things to know"
- Use comma separators: "1,000 users"

### Dates

- Relative when recent: "2 hours ago", "Yesterday"
- Absolute otherwise: "Jan 9, 2026"

### Lists

- Use bullet points for 3+ items
- End each item consistently (all periods or no periods)
- Keep parallel structure

## Localization

Wegoby supports English (LTR) and Hebrew (RTL).

### Writing for Translation

- Avoid idioms: "Piece of cake" → "Easy to do"
- Don't embed text in images
- Leave room for text expansion (some languages are 30% longer)
- Use Unicode-safe characters

### RTL Considerations

- Icons may need mirroring
- Number direction stays LTR
- Bidirectional text needs care
