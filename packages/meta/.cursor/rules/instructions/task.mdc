# Task Instructions

> **Apply Intelligently** - Task format and management in Wegoby.

## Scope

**In scope**: Task ID format, file structure, metadata
**Not in scope**: Implementation planning (→ planning.mdc)

## Task ID Format

Format: `{uuid}-{short-name}`

| Part | Format | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| UUID | 8 character hex | `a1b2c3d4` |
| Short name | kebab-case, 2-4 words | `add-book-generation` |
| Full ID | Combined | `a1b2c3d4-add-book-generation` |

### Generating UUID

```bash
# Generate 8 character hex
uuidgen | cut -c1-8 | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'
```

## Task File Format

Location: `backlog/{task-id}.md`

```markdown
# {task-id}

## Goal
What success looks like (1-2 sentences)

## Context
Why this matters, background info, relevant links

## Scope
- [ ] Specific deliverable 1
- [ ] Specific deliverable 2
- [ ] Specific deliverable 3

## Meta
- Priority: high | medium | low
- Type: feature | bugfix | refactor | docs
- Estimate: small | medium | large
- Domains: [sensetree, percepta]
- Projects: [to-read]
```

### Field Guidelines

**Goal**: One clear sentence describing success. Not implementation details.
- ✅ "Users can see their reading streak on the dashboard"
- ❌ "Add a component that fetches data and displays it"

**Context**: Why this matters. Link to related tasks, issues, discussions.

**Scope**: Checkboxes for specific deliverables. Each should be independently verifiable.

**Meta**:
- **Priority**: `high` (this week), `medium` (this sprint), `low` (backlog)
- **Type**: `feature`, `bugfix`, `refactor`, `docs`
- **Estimate**: `small` (<2h), `medium` (2-8h), `large` (>8h)

## Task Lifecycle

```
backlog/{id}.md → tasks/{id}/ → backlog/archive/{id}.md
   (planned)       (active)         (completed)
```

### States

| State | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Planned | `backlog/` | Task defined, not started |
| Active | `tasks/{id}/` | Currently being worked on |
| Completed | `backlog/archive/` | Done and archived |

## Active Task Workspace

When a task becomes active, create `tasks/{id}/`:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `task.json` | Task metadata, current phase, history |
| `context.md` | Research findings, gathered context |
| `plan.md` | Implementation plan with steps |
| `decisions.md` | Key decisions and rationale |
| `journal.md` | Timestamped progress log |
| `outcome/` | Final artifacts, summaries |
| `metrics.json` | Time spent, iterations, learnings |

### task.json Structure

```json
{
  "id": "a1b2c3d4-add-book-generation",
  "title": "Add book generation to to-read",
  "phase": "implementing",
  "workflowProfile": "full",
  "artifacts": {
    "context": "context.md",
    "plan": "plan.md",
    "decisions": "decisions.md"
  },
  "history": [
    { "phase": "creating", "timestamp": "2026-01-09T10:00:00Z" },
    { "phase": "researching", "timestamp": "2026-01-09T10:05:00Z" }
  ],
  "error": null,
  "resumable": true
}
```

## Backlog Organization

```
backlog/
├── features/     # New functionality
├── bugs/         # Bug reports  
├── improvements/ # Tech debt, refactoring
└── archive/      # Completed tasks
```
