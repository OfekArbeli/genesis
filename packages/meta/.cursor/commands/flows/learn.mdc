# /learn

Orchestrates reflection and contribution of learnings.

## Usage

```
/learn                       # Learn from current task
/learn {task-id}             # Learn from specific task
```

## What It Does

Executes in sequence:
1. `/reflect` - Compare plan vs outcome
2. `/contribute` - Add learnings to rules

## Flow

```
/learn
    │
    ├──▶ /reflect
    │       └──▶ Identifies learnings
    │
    └──▶ /contribute
            └──▶ Updates instruction rules
```

## When to Use

- After shipping a task
- After significant pivot during implementation
- When you discover something worth remembering

## Output

```
Starting: /learn

[1/2] Reflecting...
Comparing plan vs outcome...
- Time variance: +50%
- 2 learnings identified
✅ Reflection complete

[2/2] Contributing...
- Added learning to instructions/dev.mdc
- Added learning to instructions/testing.mdc
✅ Contribution complete

✅ Learning captured!
📍 Task complete. Ready for next task.
```

## What Gets Captured

### Time Analysis
- Estimated vs actual time
- Why variance occurred

### Approach Analysis
- What worked well
- What could be better

### Pattern Discovery
- New patterns found
- Pitfalls to avoid

## Dependencies

- **Mode**: Plan + Agent
- **Depends on**: Completed task
- **Produces**: Updated instruction rules

## Learning Quality

Good learnings:
- ✅ Specific and actionable
- ✅ Explains context
- ✅ Helps future tasks

Bad learnings:
- ❌ Too vague
- ❌ Too specific to one case
- ❌ Not actionable

## Example

```
> /learn

Starting learning process for: a1b2c3d4-add-reading-streaks

[1/2] Reflecting...

Time Analysis:
- Estimated: 3 hours
- Actual: 4.5 hours
- Reason: Timezone handling unexpected

What Went Well:
- Component design was clean
- Tests caught edge cases

What Could Be Better:
- Should have researched timezone handling earlier

Learnings:
1. "Timezone handling in date calculations"
2. "Test factories for complex entities"

✅ Reflection complete

[2/2] Contributing...

Adding to instructions/dev.mdc...
✅ Learning 1 added

Adding to instructions/testing.mdc...
✅ Learning 2 added

✅ 2 learnings contributed
📍 Task complete!

## Self-Improvement

The meta layer improves through learning:

```
Task completed
      ↓
/learn extracts insights
      ↓
Instructions updated
      ↓
Future tasks benefit
```

Every task is an opportunity to improve.
