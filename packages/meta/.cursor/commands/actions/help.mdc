## Commands Overview

### Actions (Level 1)

Single operations that do one thing well.

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/help` | Show available commands |
| `/create-task` | Create new task in backlog |
| `/research` | Gather context & deep analysis |
| `/plan` | Create implementation plan |
| `/implement` | Execute a plan step |
| `/validate` | Run type/lint/test checks |
| `/commit` | Commit with conventions |
| `/reflect` | Compare plan vs outcome |
| `/contribute` | Distill learnings |

### Flows (Level 2)

Orchestrate multiple actions.

| Command | Orchestrates |
|---------|--------------|
| `/prepare` | research → plan |
| `/ship` | validate → commit → summary → push |
| `/learn` | reflect → contribute |

### Pipelines (Level 3)

End-to-end workflows.

| Command | Full Flow |
|---------|-----------|
| `/do {task-id}` | prepare → implement loop → ship → learn |
| `/do {task-id} manually` | Same, with approval at each phase |

## Workflow Profiles

| Profile | Flow | Best For |
|---------|------|----------|
| Full | research → plan → implement → ship → learn | New features |
| Focused | plan → implement → ship | Medium tasks |
| Quick | implement → ship | Bug fixes |

## Getting Started

1. Create a task: `/create-task`
2. Run the full workflow: `/do {task-id}`

Or run steps manually:
1. `/research` - Understand the codebase
2. `/plan` - Create implementation plan
3. `/implement` - Execute the plan
4. `/ship` - Validate, commit, push
5. `/learn` - Capture learnings
