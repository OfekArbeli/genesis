# /research

Gather context and perform deep analysis for a task.

## Usage

```
/research                    # Research current task
/research {task-id}          # Research specific task
```

## What It Does

1. Reads task file from backlog
2. Analyzes relevant codebase areas
3. Identifies patterns and dependencies
4. Documents findings in `context.md`

## Process

### 1. Understand the Task

- Read Goal and Scope carefully
- Identify domains and projects involved
- Note constraints and requirements

### 2. Explore Codebase

- Find entry points (routes, main files)
- Trace data flow
- Identify existing patterns
- Note dependencies

### 3. Document Findings

Output to `tasks/{task-id}/context.md`:

```markdown
# Context: {task-id}

## Summary
[2-3 sentences of key findings]

## Relevant Files
- `path/to/file.ts` - Description
- `path/to/file.ts` - Description

## Existing Patterns
[How similar features are implemented]

## Dependencies
- External: [libraries, APIs]
- Internal: [services, components]

## Constraints
[Technical limitations, business rules]

## Open Questions
[Things needing clarification]
```

## Time Boxing

| Task Size | Research Time |
|-----------|---------------|
| Small | 15-30 min |
| Medium | 30-60 min |
| Large | 1-2 hours |

## Output

```
✅ Research complete → context.md created
📍 Next recommended: /plan
```

## Dependencies

- **Mode**: Agent
- **Depends on**: task.json (task file in backlog)
- **Produces**: context.md

## Example

```
